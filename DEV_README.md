    <h2>About Clay</h2>
    
    <p>Oh hey, I’m Clay (short for Claytonious).

    <p>I have the privilege of being the Lead Pastor of North Point Community Church (NPCC) in Alpharetta, Georgia, but I haven’t always been. Beginning as a facilities intern (a.k.a. Vice-President of Nothing), I worked my way through many organizational levels and learned all too well the challenge of authority deprivation.</p>

    <p>As the original and largest campus of North Point Ministries, which was ranked by Outreach Magazine in 2014 as the Largest Church in America, NPCC averages over 12,000 people in attendance. Living in the shadow of Andy Stanley, one of the greatest leaders on the planet IMHO, I understand the tension of how to lead when you’re not in charge. But truth be told, don’t we all?</p>

    <p>If you’re wondering what I do all day long, you’re not alone. In my role, I provide visionary and directional leadership for all of the local church staff and congregation in Alpharetta.</p>

    <p>With slight regret because of the torturous amount of calculus and physics, I have an Industrial Engineering from Georgia Tech. Though more applicably I have a master’s degree and a doctorate with an emphasis in Online Church from Dallas Theological Seminary. I live in Forsyth County, Georgia, with my wife, Jenny, and our four lively children, Lucy, Jake, Sally, and Cooper.</p>
